Not content with traditionally fictional writing, Woolf experiments painstakingly in her fiction to explore new ways to represent life, people, history, and the society. However, Woolf suffers from mental illness in her entire life. On March 28th, 1941, feeling the onset of another devastating breakdown, she committed suicide, and left behind a considerable quantity of novels and essays.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Critical studies centering on the author and her works range widely from the form of her fiction, her theory of fiction, psychoanalysis, feminism, to post-colonialism, narratology, ecocriticism, and even to interdisciplinary perspectives. Mrs. Dalloway, as her most gifted work, unsurprisingly gave rise to heated discussion after its coming out. Up to now, numerous studies have been published abroad and at home. Among them criticism upon space issues is not a small branch. Most relevant spatial studies concentrate on the male/female space, public/private space, or imperial/colonial space, oftentimes being restricted in the opposite binary opposition. This kind of dichotomy misses out the possibility of an otherness. Based on a different perspective, I argue that Mrs. Dalloway does not follow the dichotomous logic of space division; there exists a radical other space-Thirdspace. This thesis begins with a probe into the body space, exploring the discipline and alienation of individual bodies as spatial existence. Then it goes on analyzing the repressive urban space. Lastly, it examines the resisting space-Thirdspace, where characters achieve self-emancipation.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This thesis consists of five parts. Introduction includes a brief account of Virginia Woolf and her works, relevant literature review, theoretical foundation, and the significance of this thesis. Chapter One focuses on the body space, examining the discipline of individual body in capitalist society and its alienation in everyday life. Chapter Two sheds light on the repressive urban space, exploring the ubiquitous hierarchy, hegemony and patriarchy incarnated in space. Chapter Three discusses the possibility of Thirdspace by analyzing Clarissa's attic room, Septimus's sitting room and Elizabeth's remapping of the city. Conclusion offers a summary of the whole thesis and its argument.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="7" id="mark-75667174-3ad3-44bc-9576-94493d540b04" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Key words: Virginia Woolf; Mrs. Dalloway; Body space; Urban space; Thirdspace</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="8" id="mark-96ec5d39-5f73-441b-8a6d-57bca574ff66" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>伍尔夫《达洛维夫人》的空间解读</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>摘要</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>作为现代主义文学公认的奠基者, 弗吉尼亚 - 伍尔夫在英国文学史中的地位毋庸置疑。因为不满传统的小说写作方式, 伍尔夫终身致力探索表现生活、人类、 社会、世界的新方法。然而, 女作家一生却不断遭受精神疾病的折磨。1941 年 3 月 28 日, 伍尔夫又一次濒临精神崩溃的边缘, 她自溺而亡, 留下了数量可观的小说、散文和评论。</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>有关伍尔夫及其作品的研究范围极广, 从小说形式, 小说理论, 心理分析, 女性主义等, 到后殖民主义, 叙事学, 生态批评, 甚至有跨学科研究。《达洛维夫人》堪称伍尔夫最为出色的代表作, 自问世起即引发热议。综观目前《达洛维夫人》的学术成果, 不乏详尽深刻之作, 而聚焦其空间问题的成果也不在少数。不过现有的空间研究, 更多关注小说中的男性/女性空间, 公共/私人空间, 帝国/殖民地空间, 往往容易落入二元对立的窠臼, 忽略了其他的可能性。本文另辟蹊径, 认为《达洛维夫人》中的空间并不限于二元对立的状态, 而是存在着一种他者空间一一第三空间。基于相关前期研究, 本文试图从身体空间层面切入, 分析空间性的身体所遭受的规训及异化状态, 继而扩大到对宏观都市空间的分析, 最后探索书中作为反抗性空间存在的第三空间。</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>论文分为五部分。引言包括伍尔夫其人其作, 文献综述, 以及本文的理论背景和选题意义。第一章聚焦身体空间, 分析了作为一种空间存在的身体被社会规训, 以及在日常生活中的异化状态。第二章探究了都市空间下, 无处不在的阶级霸权与空间化的父权。第三章以克拉丽莎的斗室、赛普蒂默斯的客厅和伊丽莎白的漫游为例, 指出小说中存在一种反抗性的空间一一第三空间。结论部分总结全文, 重述本文论点。</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>关键词：伍尔夫；《达洛维夫人》；身体空间；都市空间；第三空间</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="9" id="mark-5d91f709-ac75-430f-848a-da4891fcbe75" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>Introduction</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf declares - "lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind" (56), which demonstrates her ambition and boldness both as a writer and as a woman. As a woman, she suffers from inequality in different aspects of life. Nonetheless, thanks to her father's rich collection of books, Woolf gets access to read abundant classic works at home during childhood. As a distinctive modernist writer, Woolf devotes herself to capturing the trivialness and excitement of daily life. At odds with the hollow and stuffy custom of nineteenth-century English literature, Woolf perceives the necessity of a new style to record the constantly changing modern life marked by war, urbanism, consumerism, fetishism, technology, etc. Throughout her life Woolf is relentlessly searching for new literary forms and trying experimentation in her works.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In 1908, Woolf for the first time attempted to create a novel-The Voyage Out, which unfortunately did not come out until 1915 because of the war. From 1922 to 1927 Woolf entered her peak period in creation. The successive publishing of Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, and To the Lighthouse testifies to her consummate craftsmanship and wins her nationwide prestige. Next Orlando, The Waves, and The Years, and other books are completed one after another. Her last novel Between the Acts was accomplished in 1941, shortly after which she died. In her fiction the application of stream of consciousness is most widely noticed. Along with her innovative handle of time in writing is Woolf's spatial consciousness, which also calls for our attention. Woolf deserts the traditional way of considering space as a static backdrop of events. In her works, time can be compressed or expanded; likewise, space can be juxtaposed, displaced or overlaid.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In Locating Woolf: The Politics of Space and Place, Anna Snaith and Michael H. Whitworth state, "Woolf's fictional and non-fictional writing is consistently concerned with the politics of spaces: national spaces, civic spaces, private spaces, or the textual spaces of the writer/printer" (1). In A Room of One's Own, the room, as a private space for women, is a site of maintaining female subjectivity and revolting against patriarch. In her London Scene essays Woolf depicts the space of London in detail. In Mrs. Dalloway, too, Woolf portrays diverse spaces. For example, as Anna Snaith and Michael H. Whitworth argue, the journeys of Clarissa Dalloway, Septimus Smith, Peter Walsh, and Elizabeth Dalloway link single places and sites together. Based on previous studies, firstly it is necessary for this thesis to figure out what has been done and not been done about space issues in Woolf and in Mrs. Dalloway, then what new contribution can be made to this field through this study.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="10" id="mark-a449c115-ed82-4c21-a44f-249d41c8c3ea" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In the introduction of Palgrave Advances in Virginia Woolf Studies, Anna Snaith compliments Woolf as follows, "Virginia Woolf haunts our culture. Images of Woolf . . . resurface in unexpected places, redolent with meaning. She has become a ready signifier of highbrow modernism, bohemian London, the 1970s feminism, elitism, aestheticism, madness, and the drive to suicide" (1). In "An Improper Englishwoman: Woolf as a World Writer", Maria DiBattista asserts we should view Woolf as a worldwide writer, for only by recognizing this point can we find her "exemplary achievement in excavating common ground between and cross cultures" (20). It is safe to say Woolf has not only gained firm reputation in English countries, but also evoked intense responses in non-English countries. Her innovation in fictional writing, her unique aesthetic views, and her contribution to the development of feminism are always sparkling in the sky of human history.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Before the 1970s, critics fell more on the form and techniques of Woolf's works. From the 1970s onward, criticism began to recognize and paid attention to the political and historical connotation in Woolf's works. The new century saw a diverse tendency of Woolf studies, thanks to the flourish of cultural and literary theories in recent decades. In a word, research upon Woolf and her works ranges widely from the form of her fiction, her theory of fiction, psychoanalysis, feminism, to post-colonialism, narratology, ecocriticism, and even to interdisciplinary study.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As a perfect demonstration of Woolf's consummate craftsmanship, Mrs. Dalloway has up to now appealed critics to explore its artistic value from a number of perspectives, both in form and in content. Among them stream of consciousness, modernism, psychoanalysis, and feminism have initially drawn critics' attention and still occupy a vital position nowadays. Important works include Elizabeth Abel's Virginia Woolf and the Fiction of Psychoanalysis, Nancy Topping Bazin's Virginia Woolf and the Androgynous Vision, and Rachel Bowlby's Virginia Woolf: Feminist Destinations, to name a few.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="11" id="mark-0dda9399-1e33-411e-b926-46289d603435" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Additionally, Woolf's concern for society in this book is profoundly excavated. Quite a few critics agree there is a lack of social awareness in Woolf's works. E. M. Forster has said "improving the world she would not concern" (8). Yet some began to cast doubt on it since Mrs. Dalloway came out. Mrs. Dalloway is done after the First World War, during which time convention and order have collapsed. Old beliefs have crumbled; stable life has gone; the darkness of war still haunts people's life. Conscious of the problematic society,Woolf declares in her diary that the intention of creating Mrs. Dalloway is to "criticize the social system, and to show it at work, at its most intense" (57). Her intention works itself out. At first glance this book tells the story about a hostess going out to buy flowers and hosting parties. But a close reading leads us to be aware that this is a work touching intersecting aspects of our life: gender, race, class, life, death, war, trauma, madness and civilization, etc. Thereby research concerning Woolf's social and political vision takes up not a small proportion. Suzette Henke in "Mrs. Dalloway: The Communion of Saints" writes that this book "tacitly questions tyrannical authority in all its forms, from nationalistic powermongering to conjugal appropriation" (134). Henke asserts, "society is the main character of Mrs. Dalloway". Kathy Phillips in the first chapter of Virginia Woolf Against Empire remarks that Mrs. Dalloway is a ringing indictment of a society whose values led inevitably to World War I and to the corruption of empire (5). Ashley Nadeau and Umass Amherst in "Exploring Women: Virginia Woolf's Imperial Revisions from The Voyage Out to Mrs. Dalloway" innovatively associate The Voyage Out, Mrs. Dalloway with Conrad's Heart of Darkness. They believe "both of Woolf's novels draw upon Heart of Darkness in order to recast women in the role of the roving colonial explorer" (16). In "Socialization in Mrs. Dalloway", Margaret Blanchard discusses Woolf's role as a social critic in the movement of women's liberation (287-305). Alex Zwerdling in "Mrs. Dalloway and the Social System" refutes the prejudice about Woolf's being ignorant of society and history. In particular, he highly compliments Woolf's social and political concern expressed in Mrs. Dalloway. In his view, Woolf as a satirist and social critic is "nowhere given more complete expression than in Mrs. Dalloway" (69). He explores how individuals' fate is shaped by the social environment,the historical force,wealth,class,and sex in <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="4" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D440 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45F TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D460 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>M</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Dalloway and her other novels. Based on the examination of Mrs. Dalloway and other major novels of Woolf, Karen L. Levenback in Virginia Woolf and the Great War demonstrates Woolf's "progressive awareness of the ways in which the situations of soldiers and civilians are linked by the very realities of war that are ignored both by history and theory" (i).</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="12" id="mark-1743c75c-6eb4-4849-99b3-6e438cdef056" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Along with the thrive of cultural and literary theories in the late 20th century and the early 21st century,researching perspectives about <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="5" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D440 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45F TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D460 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>M</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . Dalloway present a picture of complexity and diversity. For example, Annalee Edmonson in "Narrativizing Characters in Mrs. Dalloway" questions the traditional interpretation of splitting Clarissa Dalloway into private and public self and argues the intersubjective nature of Woolf’s central characters in Mrs. Dalloway. She seeks to demonstrate that "Woolf's text evinces a privileging of intersubjectivity-the consciousness of other consciousness-over subjectivity an individual's 'private' world as defined apart from other subjects" (17). In "Rereading the Mirror Image: Looking Glasses, Gender, and Mimeticism in Virginia Woolf's Writing", Hsiu Chuang Deppman disputes previous claims about Woolf's treatment for looking-glasses. He argues that looking-glasses in Woolf's works has not only disempowering capability, but exists as a warning of women's impotence for independence (31). He further dives into Woolf's narrative on the looking-glass vision in challenging male discourse. Olga Eliya Krochak Sulkin in "Virginia Woolf's Divergent Hospitality or Clarissa Dalloway's Struggle for Female Self Reliance" takes Mrs. Dalloway as the case, and probes into how hospitality becomes a suffrage in lives of women in the 20th century, both in public sphere and private sphere. According to the author, "although the art of admitting guests, hostessship, takes place in the private sphere of the house, Clarissa Dalloway shows that the public sphere is much more involved in this space than the private one" (401). In "Difference and Continuity: The Voices in Mrs. Dalloway", Johanna X. K. Garvey argues that Woolf subverts masculine vision of urban space and its supporting institutions by proving Mrs. Dalloway is a sea of language. In her view, "Virginia Woolf works with the different voices of her re-created London in two seemingly antagonist ways, both to unify and to fragment urban time and space" (59).</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="13" id="mark-9faea960-e067-4b96-a22e-30c2476006fd" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In short, overseas remarkable results have been made up to date. In contrast, domestic studies lag behind to some extent.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In China, Woolf translation and reception can be traced back to the 1930s. Early in 1932, the translation of Woolf's "A Mark on the Wall" done by Ye Gongchao was published in a magazine. However, studies of Woolf did not begin to flourish until the 1980s. Before entering the 21th century, Woolf's fictional techniques, her artistic ideas, and her critical theories drew critics' attention most. In this field professor Qu Shijing is a major contributor. In Virginia Woolf: A Stream of Consciousness Novelist he firstly introduces Woolf's life, her aesthetic view influenced by the Bloomsbury Group, and her exploration in theory and form of fiction. Then he interprets all of Woolf's important work creatively,among which Mrs. Dalloway is highly praised by him for its multi-layered and multi-dimensional characterization and its distinct structure; at last he summarizes Woolf's artistry, her abandon and inheritance with traditional fiction, and her significance in English literary history in particular. This is a groundbreaking research in domestic Woolf studies. Up to now it is still an essential guidance for Woolf study. At the end of the millennium, feminist readings appeared to increase. For example, Yang Yuehua in her article "French Feminist Literary Criticism and Virginia Woolf" investigates the close relationship between French feminism and Woolf thoughts. She believes that French feminism develops out of Woolf's philosophical and literary ideas. Ma Rui's "Feminist Criticism from Woolf to Cixous" begins with the two writers' language, narrative person, metaphor, etc. And he examines that Woolf's and Cixous' feminine writing serves as a tool to subvert the phallocentric logic of western conventions (1-7). Another case is Pan Jian's "Woolf's Criticism of Patriarchal System", in which he argues that Woolf deconstructs patriarchal values by blurring the division of male and female spheres (95-103). In recent years, like western study trend, domestic studies become increasingly multifaceted. Scholars like Shen Fuying, Yin Qiping, Gao Fen and Yang Lixin, have all made significant achievements. For example, in "On the Literary Theories of Virginia Woolf", Gao Fen reexamines the relationship between fiction and life in Woolf's literary notion (53-63). Wei Xiaomei in her published dissertation The Hybrid Art in Virginia Woolf's Modernist Novels studies the aesthetic paradigm of Woolf's works. In this work, she puts forward a 4P (poetry + painting + play + philosophy) pattern to conclude Woolf's artistic mode. In a word, Chinese criticism upon Woolf nowadays is promisingly advancing.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="14" id="mark-220422f5-6d68-449c-a8a4-5062eea0edc5" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Accordingly,the space issue in Mrs. Dalloway also draws critics' increasing attention with the rise and blossom of spatial theories. Locating Woolf: The Politics of Space and Place, edited by Anna Snaith and Michael H. Whitworth, collects papers of different scholars who examine comprehensively the politics of different categories of space in Woolf's writing. Here Mrs. Dalloway is seen as a series of London walk. The journeys of the main characters create networks of urban space. In "Remapping Female Subjectivity in Mrs. Dalloway: Scenic Memory and Woolf's 'Bye-Street' Aesthetic", Candis E. Bond considers how a certain type of space, for instance, the bye-street, contributes to "Woolf's development of a distinctly modernist female subjectivity based on multiplicity and trans-spatial dialogue" (64). Andrew Thacker in Moving through Modernity: Space and Geography in Modernism innovatively combines feminism, cultural studies, and theories of space together, deeply dissecting the social and historical awareness in modernist writing. When examining Woolf, he analyzes several aspects of space in Mrs. Dalloway, such as Elizabeth Dalloway's omnibus ride and Peter Walsh's strolling. Nora Larissa Wiechert in her dissertation "Urban Green Space and Gender in Anglophone Modernist Fiction" examines "the way urban green spaces, such as parks and public gardens, function as heterotopic sites within Anglophone Modernist literature" (iv). In the first chapter she explores how Woolf locates her portrayal of shell shock in reference to the green space of Regent’s Park in Mrs. Dalloway. In "Here was One Room, There Another: The Room, Authorship, and Feminine Desire in A Room of One's Own and Mrs. Dalloway", Christina Stevenson studies Virginia Woolf's "literary and theoretical conceptualizations of the room as a space that is distinguishable from, rather than merely occupied by women" (112). Youngjoo Son in her Here and Now: The Politics of Social Space of D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf, investigates spatial politics of space and its revolutionary potential in works of Lawrence and Woolf. She exemplifies the hidden class relationships and the subversive force of the working class in Mrs. Dalloway.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="15" id="mark-9fcede02-845a-47a8-a26d-f9782dbc8af0" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Domestic research on Mrs. Dalloway in regard to space is also flourishing in that spatial criticism has become a soaring study topic these years. Compared with foreign studies, domestic studies concentrate intensively on spatial politics and spatial narration in Woolf's works. For example, Qi Liang in his "The Rural Space in Virginia Woolf's Fiction and Its Cultural Implications" examines the positive role of country space against empire in Mrs. Dalloway (83-90). Wei Xiaomei's article "Metropolis, Psyche, Strata: London in Mrs. Dalloway" probes into urban people's living conditions and spiritual dilemma in the metropolitan city-London (96-102).</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Heretofore criticism both home and abroad has recognized the multifaceted spaces in Mrs. Dalloway; yet oftentimes it is inclined to fall into an either-or opposed situation, such as the opposition of male and female space, urban and country space, imperial space and colonial space, so on and so forth. To date there has been little attention on whether there is a possibility of otherness behind the seemingly immutable dichotomy. The purpose of this study is trying to find the positive answer of this question.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Space has been perceived since the ancient Greek times, whether it is in physical, scientific, or mathematical dimension. Yet the social connotation of space has not been taken seriously until the latter part of the 20th century. The first theorist who systematically examines space issues is Henri Lefebvre (1901-1991), a French philosopher and sociologist. As he puts it in The Production of Space, "Not so many years ago, the word 'space' had a strictly geometrical meaning: the idea it evoked was simply that of an empty are. . . . To speak of 'social space', therefore, would have sounded strange" (1). In this groundbreaking book, Lefebvre breaks up the binary opposition of physical and mental space, proposing the social dimension of space. He highlights that space in modern society is no longer a static and passive notion of place. Lefebvre considers space as a social product. Any space implies, contains and dissimulates social relationships-and despite the fact that a space is not a thing but rather a set of relations between things (objects and products) (83-4). What Lefebvre aims to explain is the ideological and political implications of space, or rather social space. How space is conceived, perceived and experienced plays a vital role in the operation of the society. This is most brilliantly elucidated by Lefebvre in his spatial triad, which consists of three interconnected parts-spatial practice (about how the material world is perceived), representations of space (about how the world is conceived), and representational spaces (about the world which is lived by individuals). These three dimensions contribute in different ways to the production of space.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="16" id="mark-83de8177-df30-48b2-a4d7-4b91fbb29aab" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In Production, Lefebvre also traces back the history of space, elaborately exploring the formation of space from ancient Rome and Greek cities, medieval cities to industrial cities. Along with the decline of religion and feudal system and the rise of capitalism, the form of space shifts gradually from absolute space to abstract space. Abstract space, which Lefebvre puts much emphasis on, is the space produced and dominated by capitalism. In the abstract space, hegemony aims to rule out all its differences and contradictions, which is to say to homogenize the space. That explains Lefebvre's following elucidation of differential space. For Lefebvre, the differential space is a presumably future space which contains and embraces difference and heterogeneity. Lefebvre's theory of spatial trialectics and differential space engenders direct inspiration to his student Edward Soja.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Along with the abstraction of space is the distancing of one's body from its bodily experiences, thus ending up with alienation. Alienation in Lefebvre is no longer a phenomenon in economic or political field. In modern capitalist society, alienation has become everyone's living condition in everyday life. As a Marxist philosopher, Lefebvre dedicates himself to the relation between space and society, and what role space plays in the process of capitalist expansion and accumulation. As Soja comments in his most salient masterpiece Thirdspace: To Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Spaces, it is Lefebvre who makes a "provocative spatial turn" (47) in western philosophical world.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Apart from Lefebvre, Michel Foucault (1926-1984) is another French thinker who makes great contributions to spatial criticism. Although Foucault has never dissected space systematically in his works, space does play a crucial role in Foucault's thoughts. Different from Lefebvre's preference for the social dimension of space, Foucault puts his emphasis on the relation between power, knowledge and space. Soja summarizes that "the power-knowledge link is acknowledged by every Foucaudian scholar, but for Foucault himself the relationship was embedded in a trialectic of power, knowledge, and space" (148). Space should never be forgotten in Foucault's thinking. Meanwhile, compared with Lefebvre, Foucault concerns more about individuals' suppressed condition in society. In Discipline and Punish, he examines in depth how social power disciplines individuals by examining the supervision of criminals in prisons. In the first chapter of this thesis, Foucault's idea on discipline would be applied together with Lefebvre's thoughts on this aspect. Another concept essential in Foucault's thinking is "heterotopias", which also gives inspiration to Soja's Thirdspace. In "Of Other Spaces" Foucault for the first time proposes the idea, and delineates heterotopias as "something like counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted Utopia in which the real sites, all the other sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted. Places of this kind are outside of all places, even though it may be possible to indicate their location in reality" (24). In brief, heterotopias exist in reality, able to juxtapose simultaneously different spaces; though they are hard to be found. Among them one common category in modern society is heterotopias of deviation. It refers to those places arranged for individuals whose behaviour deviates from socially acknowledged rituals, customs, and morals, such as rest homes, psychiatric hospitals, and prisons (25). Foucault commences his study from the marginalized and hidden respects of society, unraveling the underlying omnipresent power in our life.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="17" id="mark-55080077-e5ee-416b-a384-c147a2cbf074" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Postmodern geographer Edward W. Soja (1940-2015), another distinguished figure in the realm of space, absorbs and ruminates over his predecessors' thinking, forming his own unique spatial conception. In Thirdspace, Soja highlights the sociality of space:</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Social reality is not just coincidentally spatial, existing 'in' space, it is presuppositionally and ontologically spatial. There is no unspatialized social reality. There are no aspatial social processes. Even in the realm of pure abstraction, ideology, and representation, there is a pervasive pertinent, if often hidden, dimension. (46)</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Soja advocates and creatively develops Lefebvre's thoughts. He reinterprets Lefebvre's spatial practice and representations of space, and names them Firstspace and Secondspace. His most well-known notion, "Thirdspace" is inspired mainly from Lefebvre's representational spaces and also from Foucault's heterotopias. Soja believes there is an implied preference in Lefebvre's spatial trialectics, which is the lived social space, but Lefebvre never asserts it explicit. Differently, Soja explicitly elaborates its all-inclusiveness and its simultaneity of containing real and imagined spaces. This space, Soja calls it Thirdspace. What Soja intends to convey by proposing Thirdspace is trying to break the dichotomy between material and mental, opening up our mind to another space of openness and otherness. It is not simply the combination of its binary antecedents; in contrast it is a deconstruction of the two dimensions and then a reconstitution. "It is both a space that is distinguishable from other spaces (physical and mental, or First and Second) and a transcending composite of all spaces" (62). To be more insightful, Soja connects the openness and otherness of Thirdspace with feminist critique and postcolonial critique, enriching theoretical sight and scope of Thirdspace. For example, in his eyes Bell Hooks' seeking for margin as a way for black women to reconstruct subjectivity is seeking for Thirdspace. Another case is from urban historian Dolores Hayden. She describes urban city as a space of radical openness, where not only suppression and patriarchy abound but subversion and resistance occur. Soja also gives comparison between his interpretation of Thirdspace and Homi Bhabha's hybrid Thirdspace in the light of culture and post-colonialism. In my view, it would be more appropriate to say Soja provides us a new way to think, advancing an awareness to jump out of the frame of binary opposition than to provide a sort of space.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="18" id="mark-935a8f2a-b527-4616-be82-b4d5ef9822dc" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>All in all, Lefebvre concentrates mainly on excavating the significance of space on social production, Foucault focuses more on individuals' condition in space under the surveillance of power and knowledge, while Soja inspires us to reflect upon space in a new light. Each of them provides precious and sparkling spatial thinking for descendants.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In summary, drawing upon spatial theories of Henri Lefebvre, Edward Soja, and Foucault, this thesis tries to successively approach and investigate the repressed body space, the repressive urban space, and the promising Thirdspace in Mrs. Dalloway. The body, as a spatial existence, is repressed both in its own space and in social space. Nonetheless, it does not wait to be restricted. Though fragile and vulnerable, the body is always seeking to revolt and subvert. In the other space-Thirdspace, the suppressed body overturns the original order, breaks up the binary opposition and regains freedom and completeness as a person. Through probing into the three interrelated dimensions of spaces,the conventional dichotomous space focus of Mrs Dalloway is overturned and this provides new inspiration for future studies.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="19" id="mark-094512d7-26f7-44eb-8fca-2b84bc51e7be" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>Chapter One</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>The Repressed Body Space</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The human body is our basis and foundation to live in this universe. It is the bridge to connect us with the outside world. Despite this, the importance of the body has been long overlooked. As Lefebvre states in Production, traditional western philosophy has denied the body, betrayed the body, and abandoned the body (407). Contemporary theoretical thought, across beyond the old concept of subject and object, "has re-embraced the body along with space, in space, and as the generator (or production) of space". What does Lefebvre mean by considering the body as the generator of space? He gives us an example. When a person arrives at an unknown place, he "first experiences it through every part of his body". "For it is by means of the body that he perceived, lived-and produced" (162). That explains why the body produces space, and further it declares that the body is a spatial existence. The production of space thus commences from the production of the body. Simultaneously the body always occupies certain space, be it moves or not. In fact, all human activities start from the body, and end with the body. Lefebvre believes there is an intimate relationship between the body and its space: "each living body is space and has its own space: it produces itself in space and it also produces that space" <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="6" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup><mjx-mrow space="2"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c28"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c37"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c30"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c29"></mjx-c></mjx-mo></mjx-mrow></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>170</mn></mrow><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . He further expounds how the body and space interrelates with each other: "the body with the energies at its disposal, the living body, creates or produces its own space; conversely, the laws of space, which is to say the laws of discrimination in space, also govern the living body and the deployment of its energies".</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>To summarize, Lefebvre regards the body space as the basic and fundamental unit of social space. Body and space, the two elements are interdependent. In essence, the body is itself a space; on one hand, it actively participates in the production of space; on the other hand, it is unavoidably restricted by the rules of the production of space, in that the space of the body cannot freely amplify. Thus accordingly the body and its space would encounter suppression and confinement. In modern capitalist society, the bourgeoisie designs space for the sake of its own interests, thereby resulting in the extreme use of space. Under such circumstances, the body and its energy are confined and restrained to the utmost. This so-called "laws of discrimination of space" finds response in Foucault's idea of discipline. As Foucault expounds in Discipline and Punish, the body is the site where power intends to manipulate and discipline. Our society is a society of surveillance. Through surveillance and discipline on individual bodies, the authority achieves stable command of the society. Under such severe disciplinary norms, most bodies get tamed and behave according to the accepted laws and morals, but at the same time alienation occurs and permeates our life.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="20" id="mark-04c8abeb-e776-46da-ac2c-d445d8553891" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Since that the whole social space proceeds from the body, the anatomy of body space is conducive to a better understanding of social space. Therefore, this chapter aims to figure out how individuals in Mrs. Dalloway are being repressed in terms of body space. Part A exposes the phenomenon of individual bodies being disciplined in the capitalist society. Part B focuses on the alienation of individuals in everyday life.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>A. Discipline in the Capitalist Society</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As Lefebvre remarks in Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time, and Everyday Life, our body has its natural rhythm, such as breathing, beating, eating, sleeping, and so on. In ancient agricultural society, people live generally according to their biological rhythms. As society develops and advances, people have to adjust themselves in accordance with the society's rhythm. For example, individual desire, entertainment, and even body gestures, movements and manners are all impacted and altered by the industrial society. Between these two kinds of rhythms, our body, as the joint point of nature and society, makes efforts to achieve a dynamic balance. Later with capitalism gradually taking over the dominant position, human beings' biological rhythm comes into more and more conflict with the capitalist rhythm, such as industry, business, economy, and technique. This phenomenon causes increasing restriction and confinement to individual bodies. Then by which means does the capitalist society achieve the control over the body? According to Lefebvre, it is through "dressage". Dressage, which originally means the technique to tame horses, here in Lefebvre signifies social training and disciplining. "To enter into a society, group or nationality is to accept values (that are taught), to learn a trade by following the right channels, but also to bend oneself (to be bent) to its ways. Which means to say: dressage" (Rhythmanalysis 39). It is through dressage that people's natural rhythm gives way to social order, paradigms and power. Consequently, the individual body is reduced to be an object, not a subject any more. Lefebvre's dressage strikes a similar cord with Foucault's notion of discipline, which highlights the formidable social power imposed on human bodies. In a word, whether we call it dressage or discipline, it uncovers the repressed condition of the body in modern capitalist society.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="21" id="mark-47cfa6ee-2e9f-413e-a592-d4e9b266a895" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In the capitalist society, individual bodies suffer from different kinds of disciplinary power,and their body energies are constrained either; in Mrs. Dalloway these power comes from the royalty, police, military, religion, medical authority, etc. Meanwhile, people's body energies are restricted in terms of all aspects. To put it simply, all these categories of disciplining are nothing more than means of the bourgeoisie to consolidate their privileges.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The first kind of disciplinary power comes from the royalty. When Clarissa was selecting flowers, a car stopped in the street. This stirred immediately turmoil in the crowd. People started to guess one after another who was sitting inside the car. Clarissa witnessed this scene as well. Instantly a sense of solemnity arose from her heart. Next Clarissa's action calls for our attention. "She stiffened a little; so she would stand at the top of her stairs" (14). No one tells Clarissa how to behave in front of the Queen or the Prince. Only thinking of the possibility that the Queen may be sitting inside, Clarissa unconsciously adjusts her body gesture. This tiny body movement bespeaks how formidable is the disciplinary power of royalty. The fact is that not only Clarissa, but all people at the scene behave seriously and in good order as if they have been trained. Each person stopped his action and shifts attention to the car, casting solemn and adoring sight to it. Mr. Bowley even raised his hat and held it high as the car approached. Simultaneously a sense of deep affection pervaded everyone's heart. After the car had passed, the public still gazed at it teeming with the same veneration on their faces. Without rehearsal, strangers looked at each other and thought of the national flag, and the empire. Pertaining to this either coincidental or explainable phenomenon, Woolf describes as follows: "Something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument, though capable of transmitting shocks in China, could register the vibration; yet in its fullness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional" (15). It is only the authority of royalty that can make such a far-reaching impact. The more imperceptible it seems to be, the more formidable the force is.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="22" id="mark-1e8490de-eed7-4041-a6b1-63882571fc39" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The car scene also testifies to the authority of the police and the military. I might as well analyze the action of an elderly woman. The old lady was so excited to witness this situation that she would have tossed a bunch of roses into the street to show her delight, if it were not the policeman was keeping an eye upon her. The power of the police forces this old woman to notice her behavior in public. Her individual body instinct is submerged and supplanted by a trained alternative in accordance with social paradigms.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Another case is when Peter left Clarissa's home, he saw boys in uniforms, carrying guns marching ahead of him. These boys marched forward solemnly, with their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression of duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England. On seeing this, Peter began to step with them, regarding it as a fine training. The military is the executer of the ruling class. Like the police, its function is to consolidate the governance of the ruling class. So soldiers must strictly abide by its rules, disciplines and carry out its will; as for common people, they must bow to its force. For Lefebvre, every state is born of violence, and "the spread of sovereign power was predicated on military domination" (Production 280). Thus, by virtue of the power of military and police, the supremacy of the ruling class is consolidated and internalized in people's mind.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In addition, people also suffer from discipline of the suffocating religion. In Mrs. Dalloway the embodiment of religion is Miss Kilman, who used to be an outstanding girl student. She was proficient in modern history. She had got her degree. However, she was dropped out of school for her German blood and her attitude towards her German friends. In order to heal her anguish and anger, she turned to religion for help. Her convert to God was tainted somehow a sense of irony. She heard the priest preach and the boys sing. And then the priest told her God would show her the right way, after which she started to regard herself as the agent and spokesman of religious power, attempting to lay hold of other people through the disciplinary power of religion. As a matter of fact, Miss Kilman was originally the victim of religious authority. However, after she converted to Church, she became an executer of the oppressive religious power.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="23" id="mark-b5c46ce5-a94f-4f34-b6c9-a3626fcc6f30" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When she met with Clarissa, all she cared about was how to overcome and subdue Clarissa. It was also worth noting that, according to Clarissa's observation, Miss Kilman was always wearing an umbrella all the year. Miss Kilman hid her body figure behind the umbrella. In doing so, her female vulnerable identity was covered and concealed. Hence Miss Kilman turned from a victim of religious hypocrisy to an accomplice of it. When she encountered Clarissa, her intention to conquer Clarissa was exposed without disguise. For example, she glared and glowered at Clarissa's delicate body, her pink face, her air of freshness and fashion, thinking "if only she could make her weep; could ruin her; humiliate her; bring her to her knees crying" (117). Clarissa was terrified under such vicious gaze. In fact, Clarissa was not unconscious of what Miss Kilman represented. She was not shocked by Miss Kilman the person, but by the idea behind it. "The cruellest things in the world, she thought, seeing them clumsy, hot, domineering, hypocritical, eavesdropping, jealous, infinitely cruel and unscrupulous dressed in a mackintosh coat, on the landing" (118). Clarissa knew clear it was the overwhelming religious authority behind Miss Kilman wanted to devour people like her. Even after she had left her home, Miss Kilman was still haunted by the idea "it is the flesh she must control" (120).</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Another kind of disciplinary power derives from medical surveillance. The experience of First World War veteran Septimus Smith may be the most salient example in demonstrating it. The prestigious doctor William Bradshaw was an unswerving apologist of medical authority. He asserted that it was through efforts of medical dominance that England became prosper, lunatics were secluded, childbirth was forbidden, or in a word, irrationality was eliminated. Septimus got mental disease after returning back from the battlefield. After just asking him several questions, William Bradshaw diagnosed him to be seriously ill and that he must be sent to a nursing home, where he would have rest-"a long rest in bed" (89). Woolf then describes for us in a sardonic tone what kind of nursing home it is: "order rest in bed; rest in solitude; silence and rest; rest without friends, without books, without messages; six months' rest; until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve" (92). What sounds more ridiculous is that according to Bradshaw, all people should drink milk in bed. Perhaps Woolf's longtime psychiatric treatment accounts for her authentic and scornful description of psychiatric treatment. As Foucault illustrates, in modern society, the manipulation of the body is no longer performed by direct corporeal punishment; it is now carried out by omnipresent surveillance in society, especially in institutions like schools, hospitals, and prisons. In essence, the nursing home in Bradshaw's mouth is a prison to discipline and supervise those so-called abnormal people. As for what was abnormal in Septimus, seen in Bradshaw's eyes, the problem of Septimus was that he is not having a sense of "proportion" (90). That is to say his behaviour is not consistent with standard social norms. As a result, Septimus had to be comparted in the nursing home, so as not to affect society's smooth operation, until he was disciplined and altered to accept Bradshaw's sense of proportion. Besides, William Bradshaw, as the spokesman of the medical system, knew well it was for himself an absolute victory, for behind him there was police and the good of society; if patients refused to accept his treatment, they would associate with other social power to take those "unsocial impulses" (95) in control. Under the mighty disciplinary power of medical authority, ordinary people have no choice but to surrender and behave according to fixed rules, thus solidifying the governance of the ruling class.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="24" id="mark-df110b1d-b4be-46c1-bd34-84b1ad87d02b" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The last category of discipline lies in people's loss of sensation. For Lefebvre, our body is a machine operating by producing energy. In Production, Lefebvre claims that the spatial body is run by two aspects of energy. One is the "massive supplies of energy (from the alimentary and metabolic sources)," the other is "refined and minute energies (sense data)" (195). The ideal condition would be the harmonious cooperation of these two aspects. However, in the capitalist society the reality is that the latter takes the upper hand. Those organs which produce and consume massive supplies of energy are covered and numbed, thus causing the conflicts between "knowledge and action, head and genitals, and desires and needs" (196). This eventually leads to the dominance of abstraction instead of experience. For example, nowadays buildings and advertisements tend to stimulate people’s visual sensation,while other organs of bodies are omitted. <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="7" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c32"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In Mrs. Dalloway, London is a city replete with signs and symbols which reduce people's bodily experiences into visual level. Where people used to live with their body energies fully liberated now turns into a space in which massive energies are submerged and minute energies are predominant. When Clarissa walked in the street, she was fascinated by the bustling and prosperous Bond Street. The flags were flying; shops were welcoming customers. She could see a salmon on an iceblock, pearls in the jewelry stores, and one roll of tweed in the clothing store. The city was teeming with visual signs; thus people became more inclined to visually experience their lived space. When the airplane flied on the sky and writing letters with white smoke, all people began to observe what letters it was writing. Their speculation may be different, but all were linked to some sort of commodities-without exception. The plane, which embodied the consumption-oriented and reasonable bourgeoisie, here also stimulated people's visual sense. Other sensations of the body are degenerated in this space inundated with visual symbols. As for Hugh, Sir Bradshaw and his wife, their luxuriant life was to the utmost merely visually experienced. For example, Hugh's fondness for jewelry, and Bradshaw's extravagant furniture were all the outcomes of the pervasion of body energy used in the capitalist society.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="25" id="mark-0af400e1-af2e-415b-958a-890952bb522c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>B. Alienation in Everyday Life</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>For Lefebvre, the disciplining force of the capitalist society causes a split between self and self, and between one's fleshly body and its lived experiences (Production 202). That is to say the machine-like capitalist rhythm results in alienation. As a Marxist advocator, Lefebvre approves of Marx's alienation theory, which concentrates on alienation in political and economic fields. While confirming on Marx's theory, Lefebvre extends alienation from "the domain of work in particular to everyday life in general" (Shields 40). In Critique of Everyday life, Lefebvre remarks "the alienation of the worker by fragmented labour and machines is only one aspect of a larger - a total alienation which as such is inherent in capitalist society and in man's exploitation of man" (37). <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="8" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> In other words,here alienation has expanded to be an omnipresent phenomenon in the capitalist society. Rob Shields summarizes that Lefebvre's alienation is "a spatial concept referring to displacement and distance" (40). Thus Lefebvre's alienation refers not only to the feelings of fragmentation and estrangement. It emphasizes more on the distancing of one from one's own body and one's bodily experience, and one's displacement in everyday life. Next I shall try to analyze individuals’ alienation in everyday life in Mrs. Dalloway, which is largely reflected on Clarissa and Septimus under Woolf’s pen. <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="9" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c34"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container></div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="26" id="mark-82306ec5-f718-483d-98ef-c4ed3e2c09b3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The first point is the sense of self-fragmentation and estrangement prevalent in the novel. For example, when walking alone in the street, Clarissa unintentionally spoke out her weird feeling about her body. "She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on. She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out far to sea and alone" (6). Clearly she was not old in terms of the biological age, living a peaceful and harmonious life, an enviable hostess; yet deep down she was rootless and lifeless. When she was told that Lady Bruton invites Richard for lunch, leaving Clarissa alone, she suffered another sick experience: "so she rocked; so she shivered" (26). She felt herself "suddenly shriveled, aged, breastless" (27). When her party began, Clarissa stood at the landing, feeling herself like "a stake driven in at the top of her stairs" (160). At first glance Clarissa lived freely. She could hold parties; she could go out to buy flowers; she could have dogs and maidens; yet all of her activities were controlled and arranged by the oppressive bourgeoisie. Her true self was submerged under its manipulating rhythm. Living like a puppet, a sense of estrangement occurred. "often now this body she wore, this body, with all its capacities, seemed nothing -nothing at all. She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible; unseen; unknown" (8). Besides, she had the deep feeling that everyone was living in isolation, living like a waste of life. This kind of bizarre feeling is also exhibited in Septimus' relationship with himself, with other people, and with the external world.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As a lower-middle class veteran of psychological disorder, Septimus was sensitive enough to feel the hostility of the external world. Sitting on the chair in the park, looking at the pedestrians passing by, Septimus would consider "the world has raised its whip; where will it descend" (12). When the car stopped in the street, all other people gathered towards there. Septimus solely stood still and isolated, observing what happened. He saw everything was drawing together to one center, which terrified him. He used to read Shakespeare, Darwin and Bernard Shaw greedily, but after returning back from the war, when reading them again, he felt no longer the intoxication of language in boyhood; all left was loathing, hatred, and despair. What he yearned in his heart: love, universal love, and no crime, had vanished without trace. The world had discarded him. He recognized this harsh reality painfully but soberly. "The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames, it is I who am blocking the way". Thus Septimus had realized his incompatibility with the reasonable world. He lived like an isolated outsider, partly due to his illness which locates him in the marginalized situation. Another reason was the barrier between him and his wife. As a veteran coming back from the battlefield, he immersed himself in the past and rejected to face reality. Oftentimes would he recollect his life in wartime and his partner Evans. We cannot disavow that Septimus is homosexual,as Clarissa is. <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="10" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c35"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>5</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> After Evans had died in the war, Septimus often saw Evans' illusion standing in front of him. When Peter Walsh was passing in front of him, he mistook the stranger as Evans. "A man in grey was actually walking towards them. It was Evans! But no mud was on him; no wounds; he was not changed" (64). It was no surprising Septimus would be considered by both his wife Rezia and the outside world as maniac. What was more, both Rezia and Septimus could not understand one another. Septimus could feel nothing when his wife was talking and sitting beside him. As he muttered "communication is health" (87) quietly, Septimus was like some rootless grass in this city, being understood by nobody.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="27" id="mark-7036af19-70d2-434f-989f-2df971eb4e41" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As Shields points out, Lefebvre's alienation refers to spatial displacement and distance. In Clarissa's memory of life in Bourton, we could feel her deep affection and nostalgia for the countryside. In Clarissa's eyes, the air in Bourton was fresher than London; its scenery more enchanting. In her heart she was part of "the trees at home, of the house there, ugly, rambling all to its bits and pieces as it was" (7). When she read the lines of Cymbeline, a picture of dawning in the country flashed in her mind. In addition, in Bourton she could stay with Sally, her partner and homosexual love in childhood. They could accompany each other, discuss bold topics, and live regardless of other people's criticism. In comparison, life in Bourton was rife with pleasure and serenity, while life in London was cruel and stifling, as we can see. All in all, she was incompatible with London life. Living in this modern metropolis, Clarissa's reminiscence of the past generates a bout of uprootedness. With her consciousness shuttling back and forth, a sense of displacement and also a distancing from the present life occur.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="28" id="mark-82b94971-42e1-4b61-97ac-ed62626fb136" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The repeated striking of the Big Ben in this novel is also worth our attention. According to Lefebvre in Rhythmanalysis, time can be categorized to cyclical time and linear time. Cyclical time exists ubiquitously in nature. It concords with the rhythm of universe and life, as people experience the sunrise and sunset, and the changing of seasons in agriculture society. In contrast, linear time is related to technique, knowledge and reason. It comes into line with the scientific, technical social rhythm. It is the standardized time to be calculated and works for social production. The latter category of time is applied widely in capitalist society,reinforcing individual alienation. In Mrs. Dalloway, Woolf's description about her characters does not follow a certain route. Whether it is physical meandering or flowing of consciousness, we could trace its discursiveness. However, each time the Big Ben strikes, it conveys sort of severe and reasonable connotation, as if the sound is warning for something. The first time when the sound of Big Ben struck, Clarissa felt a pang of unrest. After living over twenty years in Westminster, she could still feel "a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense" (2). Though she told herself this was due to the effect of influenza. The second time it struck, it sounded "as if a young man, strong, indifferent, inconsiderable, were swinging dumb-bells this way and that" (43). When doctor Bradshaw tried to defeat Septimus with his medical authority and his sense of "proportion", the clock struck again. It sounded as if the clock became the executer of authority. "Shredding and slicing, dividing and subdividing, the clocks of Harley Street nibbled at the June day, counseled submission, upheld authority, and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion" (95). Unlike the seriousness and accuracy of Big Ben, there was a late clock which would always strike two minutes after it. "Volubly, troublously, the late clock sounded, coming in on the wake of Big Ben, with its lap full of trifles" (119). From my standpoint, the sound of Big Ben is what Lefebvre calls linear time, its striking as a symbol to defeat people's instinctive and emotional rhythm. The highly accurate linear time supervises people's life, and desires to alter them into disciplined bodies in concord with capitalist rhythm. It is its oppressive force that precipitates Clarissa's uneasiness. Conversely, the late clock stands for the cyclical time, for it is trivial and inaccurate in terms of calculation. It does not approve of the highly standardized social rhythm, thus is covered up and overwhelmed</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="29" id="mark-b6d85881-4bf5-451d-9c05-4dc1d350bc62" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>by the authoritative time.

As is afore-mentioned, the most basic argument in Production is "space is a social product" (26). To be more concrete, social space is constituted "neither by a collection of things or an aggregate of data, nor by a void packed like a parcel with various contents, and that it is irreducible to a form imposed upon phenomena, upon things, upon physical materiality" (27). In Lefebvre, space is not a material or static thing; it is a dynamic, complicated, and ongoing process that every one of us is involved in and influenced by. The production of space seemingly refers to the production of things in space, but fundamentally, it refers to the production of space itself. To help us understand better about this concept, Lefebvre puts forward his well-known spatial triad, the three dimensions of which I have introduced briefly in the introduction part. Here since I am going to explore the pervasive hegemony, hierarchy, and patriarchy in London, this lived urban space, a detailed comprehension of the three dimensions of Lefebvre's spatial triad would be necessary.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Lefebvre has made it clear that spatial practice, representations of space, and spatial representations do not separately exist; they are interrelated together, shaping our life with their interactive force. Spatial practice refers to the embodiment of ideas, knowledge, or plans of space (theses ideas, knowledge and plans are categorized into representations of space). Representations of space are the conceptualized space. It is the ideology, the language, knowledge and discourse of space. It is the coded system that the ruling class intends to apply into the production of space. Hence, among the three concepts, it is the dominant space in our society, a political tool handled by the dominating power to manipulate people living in it. The dominating class designs how the space should be produced, how the space should be constructed, and how people should live in the space. Like Soja interprets in Thirdspace, "in these 'dominating' spaces of regulatory and 'ruly' discourse, these mental spaces, are thus the representations of power and ideology, of control and surveillance" (67). Last but not in the least, the representational space is the actual social space that every one of us lives in. To quote Lefebvre, this is "the dominated-and hence passively experienced -space" (40). Ultimately, these three dimensions are bound up one another. For one thing, representations of space try to plan and manipulate social practice, and to eliminate the contradictions and differences under spatial representations; for another the dominated and repressed in spatial representations, which is the lived space, struggle to shackle the dominating structure by spatial practice.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="31" id="mark-f7500d90-c588-41e8-a8d0-44a925515a9e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Lefebvre writes that social space works as a tool to analyze the society, so in this chapter I would like to explore how the lived urban space under Woolf's pen exerts its repressive force on people living in it. Part A focuses on the hierarchical and hegemonic power permeated in London. Part B examines the incarnated patriarchy in gendered urban space.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>A. Ubiquitous Hierarchy and Hegemony</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When analyzing the capitalist society, Lefebvre reminds us not to merely pay attention to the function of money and social relations of production. Another important aspect of the capitalist society is the hegemony of one class. The concept of hegemony is originally introduced by Gramsci to describe the future role of the working class in the building of a new society. Here for Lefebvre it is also useful in terms of "analyzing the action of the bourgeoisie, especially in relation to space" (Production 10). According to Lefebvre, hegemony can be considered as a refined notion of dictatorship. It is persuasive throughout the society, not only through institutions, but also through culture, knowledge, ideas, etc. In Mrs. Dalloway the prosperity of London is exhibited incisively and vividly by Woolf. The whole story begins with Clarissa's journey on the street. Along with Clarissa's movement in different places and her fluid consciousness, we readers also stroll from Victoria Street, Pimlico, Arlington Street, to Piccadilly, St. James's Park, etc. Meanwhile, the cityscape of London is described for us from other people's perspectives-Peter Walsh, Septimus, Elizabeth and so on. Though apparently London looks like a pretty and peaceful painting, invisible hierarchy and hegemony is lurking below the surface.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="32" id="mark-c852d726-cd81-4ed2-bd7e-2e626c6d3458" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>At the outset of the story, while Clarissa was buying flowers in the store a car stopped in the outside street. Immediately people gathered together around the car. Everyone was guessing if it was the Queen, the Prime Minister or the Prince sitting inside. In this scene the embodiment of the royal power-the car, naturally occupies the central position in the street place. The car, the person in the car, and people around it constitute a social space. As Septimus perceived, the car was drawing everything together to one center. Around the car those ordinary people were spontaneously engaged by it, and showed their respect to it. Consequently, the car, one physical object, became the central point in this social space. Looking at the car faraway, all people "perceived instinctively that greatness was passing, and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon Clarissa Dalloway" (15), no matter they were well-dressed gentlemen, ladies choosing gloves, maidens with babies, or the old Judge Sir John Buckhurst. A sense of instinctive worship for sublimity and magnificence arose from everyone's heart. "At once they stood even straighter, and removed their hands, and seemed ready to attend their Sovereignty, if need be, to the cannon's mouth, as their ancestors had done before them". It is no surprise that such a transitory scene could exert so huge an impact on people' mind, because it goes without saying that the royal class is the symbol and head of the country. It is at the very top of the social strata, with supreme power and wealth. Just as people could imagine what their ancestors have done, this invisible impact of social hierarchy and hegemony have already become ineradicable and pervasive.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Apart from the middle and rich class gathering here, a small crowd of poor people were also waiting at the gates of Buckingham Palace. Whilst everyone had the same worship for the important figure in the car, their location of space respectively showed their social status. The middle classes could take the top seats of omnibuses. While for poor people, they were excluded from the mainstream social life. With their inferior social position, they could only live in the marginalized space of this city. Hence at this moment what they could do was to wait at the gate of the Palace, in case they were lucky enough to see her majesty going out of the car. They imagined the scene of the Queen bowing and the Prince saluting; at the thought of Royalty looking at them makes their nerves thrilling. In a word, this open space implies the hierarchical structure of society. People of different classes take up different spaces with different distance from the center point. The closer they are to the center, the higher their social status is. This kind of distribution of space is exactly the realization of ideologies of ruling class in society. The so-called planning and design of space is the capitalist society's tool to defend their power.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="33" id="mark-11f8d11e-8ff2-46fb-bf42-401f595b37b0" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This deep-rooted hierarchy is also adequately manifested through the relationship of Clarissa and her servant Lucy. As a matter of fact, the opening sentence of this novel implies the hidden power relations between richness and poverty. Clarissa decided to buy the flowers herself, for "Lucy and her work cut out for her" (1). So in Clarissa's view, buying flowers should have been the duty of Lucy. It was only when Lucy being busy with other work that Clarissa undertook this obligation. Apparently in Clarissa's mind, she was the superior master, standing for the middle-class rich people. While Lucy was only a maid subordinate to her master, a member of the poor lower class. When she chose to buy flowers herself, Clarissa regarded of her deed as kindness and benignity. By this token, the rich class takes their exploitation of the poor for granted.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>After the work was done, Clarissa went back home. Seeing Lucy come forward to welcome her and hearing the cook whistling in the kitchen, she felt satisfied with her present life. And she knew this was partly due to her servants. It was their hard work and sacrifice that laid the foundation for her carefree life. From their conversation we know unlike other hostesses, Clarissa would give her maid more free time to stay in the theatre. This is another trace of the exploitation of rich class. When Lucy came forward to help her master sew the dress, Clarissa insisted doing it by herself, for Lucy had enough to do. And she said several thanks to Lucy, for it was her servants that help her "to be like this, to be what she wanted, gentle, and generous-hearted" (35). As for Lucy, she held the view that her master was the loveliest. She was graceful for Clarissa's generosity and benevolence. When Clarissa refused her help, Lucy felt shy, apparently regarding herself as inferior to her master Mrs. Dalloway. Though the rich people's wealth, kindness and generosity in essence stem from the working class, Lucy did not realize her value in the process of production. That is what the privileged class aims to achieve. With their ideology permeating all levels of society, they achieve their hegemony over ordinary people. In summary, on one hand the bourgeoisie enjoys benefits and privileges from exploiting the lower class, they reinforce their hegemony by virtue of more suppression and exploitation on the other hand.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="34" id="mark-f4731645-844b-4d65-8f19-a4efcef67adb" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Besides, Lady Bruton and Clarissa, as the representative of upper class socialite and middle class hostess, have different life circles, consisting of different social spaces. A good case in point is their parties. Both of them held parties in this novel, with hierarchy and hegemony fully revealed. Next I would examine the hidden class hierarchy in Lady Bruton and Clarissa's lived spaces by mainly analyzing the two parties and some other scenes.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>At the beginning of Lady Bruton's party, maids quietly served the food in order. With their soundless service, an illusion arose from the heart of these guests: "this profound illusion in the first place about the food-how it is not paid for; and then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver" (97). From that the upper class people consider the food as unnecessary to pay for, we can draw the conclusion that they do not notice the existence of the working class. In their eyes, food, wine, and coffee, all these things are self-efficient instead of being produced by hands of the working class. So the unprivileged working class is marginalized and overlooked. According to Lefebvre, "each state claims to produce a space wherein something is brought to perfection: namely, a unified and hence homogeneous society" (Production 281). Therefore, in the capitalist society the bourgeoisie attempts to erase its difference and contradiction, trying to disguise it as a harmonious space. This accounts for the rich class' overlook of the working class in the party. They want to deny and ignore the existence of the lower class people,forming a deceptive homogeneous picture. <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="11" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c36"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>6</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> Apropos of Lady Bruton, the hostess of this party, who also had the highest social status among her guests, naturally sit at the central seat at the table. There was a painting of a General hanging on the wall behind her. This implied the social position of Lady Bruton. When seeing this picture, Richard Dalloway conjectured about the relationship between the General and Lady Bruton. Though he did not know it for sure, he believed there was intimate blood relation between them. Thus Richard began to envisage he could serve under Lady Bruton. He said he had the greatest respect for her; "he cherished these romantic views about well-set-up old woman of pedigree" (98). To be frank, if it were not her upper class social position, Richard Dalloway would not have had such respect and compliment for Lady Bruton.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="35" id="mark-6839dbb5-7d84-4882-bd2a-46f54ee9b1d6" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>After lunch Lady Bruton asked Hugh Whitbread to help her with a letter. During this process, Woolf depicted the action of Lady Bruton's servants then. She wrote "the coffee was very slow in coming" (100). We know it is the servants who serve coffee, but guests in the party do not concern who offer the service. They merely care about when the coffee is ready. For another time Woolf exhibits us the marginalized situation of the lower class. Ranking the lowest level in social strata, they are repressed all the time.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Lady Bruton's mediation after the party probably speaks best for her authority. "Power was hers, position, income. She had lived in the forefront of her time" (104). With her steady economic, social, and power foundation, Lady Bruton naturally had the confidence in leading the world. In her imagination, she was as competent as her ancestors who had marched to Canada. "Murmuring London flowed up to her, and her hand, lying on the sofa back, curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held, holding which she seemed, drowsy and heavy, to be commanding battalions marching to Canada". In some sense, here in London, this modern urban space, she was exerting her power like her deceased ambitious grandfathers. Living in the upscale community-Mayfair, she occupied the pivotal physical space of this city; meanwhile, by safeguarding the ideologies of ruling class and exploiting poor people, she also took up the central position in the lived social space.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Next I would like to shift my focus to Clarissa's party. Owing to their different social status, the parties of Lady Bruton and Clarissa present distinct features. The key point is they both expose the exploiting nature of the bourgeoisie in the same way.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Before the party began, the servants of the Dalloways were intensely preparing. Lucy, Agnes, and Mrs. Walker were all busy with their work. Still, as usual, their efforts were done behind the stage. Lucy was assuring if all cultery and chairs were ready upstairs. When she heard that the guests were coming up, she quickly retreated back from the drawing-room in case to be seen by the guests. And the news that the Primme Minister would come made no difference for Mrs. Walker, the cook, for she was among the plates, saucepans, and other affairs in the kitchen. The frivolousness and joyfulness was for the rich, not for the lower class constrained by endless work. In the same way, the bright and gorgeous drawing-room was for guests and the Dalloways. The only place where they can stay was the small and neglected kitchen.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="36" id="mark-caab4513-6f39-4032-a0f7-9d3fa6ecd93e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When the party began, guests went upstairs one by one. Clarissa greeted passionately to everyone, though from the bottom of her heart she did not welcome all. For example, she did not want to invite Ellie Henderson at all. As we were told, Ellie Henderson was a poor old lady whose family had only three hundred pounds a year and she herself could not earn a penny. Then it was understandable why Mrs. Dalloway was unwilling to invite her. Even Ellie herself felt incompatible with this party. Her weaponless condition "made her timid, and more and more disqualified year by year to meet well-dressed people" (158). The insurmountable gap between her and the rich class made Ellie unpopular in the party. Nobody talked to her or invited her to dance, except for several greetings Richard Dalloway gave her. She could only secretly appreciate the dazzling dresses of ladies and misses. Ellie, like the servants of the Dalloways, accepted her subordinate social rank without protest. The hegemony of the bourgeoisie had been infiltrated into the lower class seamlessly. Clarissa did not welcome Hugh and Sir William Bradshaw either, but she had to be enthusiastic for them, for both of them stood for the upper class of English society. Hugh was proud of his office in the court, which was clearly shown from his intentional flattery for Lady Bruton. And William Bradshaw was a prestigious doctor living in the upscale communities like Lady Bruton. Hence though Clarissa knew well his coldness and hypocrisy, she had to treat him solemnly and carefully.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When the Prime Minister showed up, the focus of the whole party fell upon him. Lady Bruton instantly stepped forward to welcome him; immediately some people began to spy and some guarded outside the door. Though going on talking, all people were conscious that the majesty, the symbol of English society, was passing. "A stir and rustle rippled through every one openly: the Prime Minister!" (161). All of a sudden the Prime Minister became the centre of this little social space. No wonder that Clarissa and Richard would feel very pleased and honored for his coming.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>No matter it is in Lady Bruton's or Clarissa's party, the hierarchy and hegemony of the bourgeoisie is fully revealed. The upper class confidently enjoys the best resources and service, while the lower class people who make the most contributions are neglected.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="37" id="mark-376c70be-cdcf-403d-bf8e-f79243488024" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>B. Patriarchy Incarnated in Space</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Lefebvre has made it clear that social space contains and assigns (more or less) appropriate places to the social relations of reproduction, and the relations of production. He then explains the former links to the bio-physiological relations between the sexes and between age groups, along with the specific organization of the family (Production 33). His statement implies that sexual relations, family structures, or the division of labour between men and women are all encoded by space. Indeed, in Mrs. Dalloway, besides the ubiquitous class hierarchy and its hegemony on people, the dominance of men upon women permeates people's lived space as well.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>I shall begin my analysis with Clarissa's short encounter with Hugh Whitbread. At the beginning scene, Clarissa walked casually on Victorian street, then Hugh came forward towards Clarissa along with his back against the Government buildings. According to Lefebvre, "the arrogant verticality of skyscrapers, and especially of public and state buildings, introduces a phallic or more precisely a phallocratic element into the visual realm" (98). As for the purpose of this kind of display, it is to convey its violent power to each spectator. Since what this verticality and great height of buildings expresses is phallocratic power, its metaphorical implication falls more on women. Here the person Hugh is integrated into the symbol of male power-the Government buildings. Together they form an overwhelming force to the repressed gender.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Similar scenes can also be found in the latter part of the book. A telling example is Peter Walsh's finding on his way to Clarissa's dinner party. He witnessed a scene in Westminster street. "And here a shindy of brawling women, drunken women; here only a policeman and looming houses, high houses, domed houses, churches, parliaments, and the hoot of a steamer on the river, a hollow misty cry" (154). This is a painting rife with phallocratic features. Here the high houses, churches, and parliaments are all embodiments of male dominance. Standing uprightly, they constitute a threatening and opposite implication together with the policeman. Another case in point is Peter Walsh's wandering of thoughts when he came out from Clarissa's home. After he stepped on the street, a sense of manliness arose from his heart. Interestingly, seeing his shadow reflected in the plate-glass window of a motor-car manufacturer in the Street, he could not help exuding overwhelming confidence: "All India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera; a district twice as big as Ireland" (44). A woman can never feel the same when she stands on the street, due to that streets, parks, and magnificent architectures are all redolent of masculinity. Only a man with his will unnecessary to be subdued can generate an affinity with these places. Later Peter noticed a stranger - a beautiful young lady walking in front of him. He then quietly followed this lady from the square, to the shop, and to another street. Following behind her, Peter Walsh observed the young lady secretly. In imagination he appreciated her wisdom, her enchantment, her discreet and merry; he had even invited her for a coffee. When the fruitless romantic adventure was over, this was how Peter described his feeling: "he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed a romantic buccaneer" (49). Seen in Peter's light, this furtive following was a journey of victory and conquest. Indeed, like an empire's conquest of its colony, he exalted himself as the conqueror of women.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="38" id="mark-65ba3d77-9a42-4b8a-b9f1-26bb775d47a1" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Then the Queen's car comes into sight on the street. In my view, besides demonstrating class hierarchy, this scene also manifests the division of male and female space. We could notice that when the car passed, ladies who were choosing gloves in stores stop. Compared with male citizens who were free to walk and wander in the street, women were confined in the traditionally feminine spaces, like stores, malls, homes, etc. Therefore, this transitory scene illustrates the invisible patriarchy hidden in urban space. By defining and arranging space as what is conceivable for them, the male-dominated society consolidates their authority. After the car passed, a young girl Maisie Johnson got lost and puzzled in the park. She had just arrived at London from her hometown. This bizarre and aggressive city reminded Maisie of her home. An old lady saw through her sadness and recalls her own young time, which was teeming with grief and misery. She had experienced the pressure of being a woman in this society and a husband's wife at home. During this short while the old woman along with the young girl, were victims exposed to the open space.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Patriarchy articulated through division of gendered spaces can be more convincingly attested through comparison among Clarissa's activity space and Peter's and Richard's. Richard could stay outside and go back home with no restriction. He could go to the parliament freely. He was also invited to Lady Bruton's party. However, Clarissa had to stay at home and devotes herself to trivial family events. Before they got married, Clarissa liked reading Shakespeare and Shelley, and rose. Clarissa had enthusiastic passion about life and nature. Things had changed since Clarissa entered Richard's house and turned to be Mrs. Dalloway. Contrary to Clarissa, Richard disdained poetry. He only wanted to talk about Armenians with her after lunch. And Richard had not in the least a sense of romance. Now in order to conform to Richard's interest, Clarissa had to abandon her own literary appetite, dedicating herself to holding parties, saying things not out of her true feelings, losing her mind and criticism. In such a depressive condition, Clarissa found her own voice silenced. "With twice his wits, she had to see things through his eye . . . with a mind of her own, she must always be quoting Richard" (71). When she felt uncomfortable, Richard insisted on her sleeping in the attic room. This was the only place totally belonging to Clarissa. At the evening, when guests came and the party began, even the drawing-room became a public space where Clarissa had to wear the mask of an educated senator wife. All other places of their large house except for the little room had already become the incarnation of Richard Dalloway's mind, voice, and his masculine power.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="39" id="mark-2672b156-e1be-4952-9b8f-cce56b6c9173" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As for Peter Walsh, he could aimlessly stroll everywhere. When he sat in a restaurant, people would admire his manliness, his gentle manners. When Peter went to visit Clarissa, Clarissa was sewing her dress at her bedroom. On hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, Clarissa instantly hid her dress, Woolf described her action as "a virgin protecting chastity, respecting privacy" (36). This instantaneous mental activity manifested Peter's invasion of her last personal space. Peter's sudden visit and his sudden intrusion into her private space gave Clarissa certain terrified feeling-she felt herself like a Queen whose guards had went to sleep and left her unprotected, so that everyone can strolled in and had a look at her. Clarissa's metaphor here precisely explained her situation then. Her last small patch of personal space was deprived by the male aggressive force. In the past, when Clarissa sat together with Sally, meditating upon life, Peter intervened in with his patriarchal tyranny. Once again Clarissa perceived his hostility, and his determination to break up their companionship. Falling in with women like what Clarissa did was unacceptable in a patriarchal society, so Peter, as its representative, determined to ruin their relation. And when at the party, whilst Clarissa tried to be calm, deep down she kept being attacked by Peter's attitude. And Clarissa was well aware of Peter's power on her. "She could see Peter out of the tail of her eye, criticizing her, there, in that corner. . . . It was extraordinary how Peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner" (157). Whilst Peter was standing at the corner of the party, Clarissa could still feel his invisible intimidation casted on herself.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="40" id="mark-a46d9a6b-cc56-418c-a675-da4e3ac3cae5" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Before her party got started, Clarissa stood at the landing, listening to the voice of tapping, knocking, opening the door, and of repeating a message. She realized how strange it was that to be a mistress in charge of all of these domestic affairs. At this moment Clarissa became aware of her imprisoned predicament, her defined role of being a housewife in this male-dominated society. As was further testified in the later passage, her husband Richard had no idea how the layout a drawing-room should be. Home had been labeled as women's place, meanwhile establishing an entrapment for them. It should be no wander that Clarissa would imagine that she could have a body like Lady Bexborough. For one thing, Lady Bexborough was the representative of upper class rich people. Compared with Clarissa, she was less confined and manipulated by social power. Hence she had less confinement in physical space. More importantly, for the sake of her body image, Lady Bexborough was a man-like woman. She had dark skin, stately manner, with intense interest in politics and imperial cause like men. Last but not in the least, she had got a house in the country (8). A house in the country sounded quite tempting for a woman entrapped in her limited house. If Clarissa could also have a country house, then it would be a space of her own, a space with no tint of patriarchy. Besides, in Clarissa's party we know that Sally is once kissed by Hugh. Due to that Sally approved of women's right to vote, Hugh "punished" her by kissing her in the smoking-room (170). With his male superiority, Hugh carried out his power in the traditional masculine space - the smoking-room. Thereafter in this party they met again. This time Sally still did not have the courage to greet him. However, Hugh was as arrogant as he was before, passing by her with excessive self-esteem. Wherever he was, Hugh always possessed his dominance over Sally.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="41" id="mark-c6560cb7-9d42-460f-a16c-0e4e709b32fb" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Finally, there is one person overlooked in Lady Bruton's party demanding our attention-Lady Bruton's secretary Miss Milly Brush. From the beginning to the end of the party, Miss Brush had little chance to utter a word. Her obligation was to assure the guests' satisfaction and pleasure at the party. As long as Lady Bruton nodded, Milly Brush knew it was time for coffee. When the party was over, she was detached to fetch papers. She was angry about Hugh's offensive remarks, but Lady Bruton did not take it seriously. As for what Lady Bruton, Hugh and Richard discussed at the table, she was not qualified to intervene in. Apart from Miss Milly Brush's oppressed condition, even though Lady Bruton wa the representative of upper class, she was also a victim of the patriarchal society. Though she had enviable power and wealth, she was not confident with her capability of writing. In her mind, men had more talent than women in commanding a language, and they had more accurate understandings to the laws of universe. Thus, even though she did not like Hugh, Lady Bruton considered it to be necessary to ask Hugh for help. When he finished writing, Lady Bruton could not help gratefully calling him, "my Prime Minister" (103). This flattering appreciation speaks itself Lady Bruton's succumbing to patriarchy.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In conclusion, in Mrs. Dalloway patriarchy is incarnated both through spatial structure and disposition of gendered spaces. With male dominance articulated and permeated in space, women are entrapped into the repressive social net.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="42" id="mark-3198589c-51d7-4b82-8e3f-3312422d10c7" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>Chapter Three</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>The Promising ThirdSpace</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As Lefebvre says, "the fleshly body is already in revolt" (201). The repressed individual bodies in Mrs. Dalloway do not resign to their fate passively; conversely, they try to regain subjectivity and attain self-emancipation by seeking for Thirdsapce. As in the title of his Thirdspace, Soja's notion of ThirdSpace is not a distinct and concrete one. In Soja, Thirdspace, as an otherspace, is unique for its radical openness and unlimited possibility. It is neither Firstspace (material space) nor Secondspace (mental space), yet it contains them both. It is both real and imagined, abstract and concrete, repetitive and differential. What I am going to demonstrate below is that Woolf's spatial writing in Mrs. Dalloway resonates with Soja's Thirdspace.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In fact, the study of space has a long history in feminism. For instance, Doreen Massey in her Space, Place, and Gender, argues the role of space and place in everyday and political life, especially the interconnections among space, place and gender. She emphasizes the influence of space and place in the construction of gender relations. From her argument and exemplification, we can recognize the feminist tradition of labeling space and place as domestic and public, which refers to male and female. Accordingly this kind of division focuses on male dominance and gender inequality, and women's oppressed situation in the patriarchal society, falling into an insoluble predicament. Nevertheless, Woolf does not restrict herself in the immutable dichotomy. Her writing, whether it is of fiction or non-fiction, endeavors to get rid of the binary dilemma and search for another possibility in a hegemonic society.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As is well known,Woolf in A Room of One's Own announces the necessity of owning a room for a woman who wants to be a writer. Though the image "room" is unusually considered as a place for women, Woolf's notion of room takes on some different connotation. In Woolf's eyes, "room" becomes neither a simply male or female space; rather, it transcends the classification, embodying both a symbol and a solution for women to maintain independence. It is only in a room of her own that a woman can think and write free from disturbance and hegemony. Thus this individual room, as an otherspace,assures a woman’s subjectivity and integrity. In A Literature of their own: British Women Novelists From Brontë to Lessing, Elaine Showalter has examined the subversive value of Woolf's room. She considers her room as both a sanctuary and prison, in which space "her women observe a more violent masculine world in which their own anger, rebellion, and sexuality can be articulated at a safe move" (264). An otherspace brimming with possibility and difference, Woolf' room of her own identifies with Soja's Thirdspace. In addition, my standpoint can also be evidenced by her innovation of androgyny. Woolf is deeply aware that men and women fix themselves into rigid roles, and as they do so, overlook their fuller personality. She writes "it is fatal to be a man or a woman pure and simple, one must be a man-womanly or a woman-manly" (75). Woolf's emphasis on sexual fluidity and fusion reflects her questioning on the fixed gender identity, which is ahead of her own time. This is explicitly unfolded in Orlando, in which the protagonist lives first as a man but later as a woman. Though Mrs. Dalloway is published before Orlando and A Room of One's Own, it is not difficult to find the sprout of Woolf's insightful view on gender in this earlier work.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="43" id="mark-bad120a0-9144-4551-ac80-f9a500c4bcd6" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This chapter intends to anatomize how the repressed individuals (here I select Clarissa, Septimus, and Elizabeth as examples) manage to regain and retain their subjectivity in Thirdspace. Part A elucidates Clarissa's self-revival in the attic room. Part B is of Septimus' resistance against social morals in his sitting-room. Part C traces how Elizabeth accomplishes self-emancipation by wandering and exploring in London street.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>A. Clarissa's Room of Her Own</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As we have mentioned above, Clarissa was oppressed and disciplined by the hierarchical and patriarchal society. In consequence, Clarissa had to hide her true self and dressed up as an impeccable hostess in public and a tender wife in front of her husband Richard Dalloway. For example, Clarissa had to part from her homosexual lover Sally Seton and chose a man to marry; she was oppressed by the autocratic spokesman of religion-Miss Kilman. She had to relinquish her own interests and held endless parties to help Richard with his career. Despite these, Clarissa still managed to approach her subjectivity by searching for Thirdspace-an actual personal space in her house. As a private place, house is unusually regarded as a space of entrapment for women, so is it in Mrs. Dalloway. Even so, she was not able to live freely in such a so-called female place. She was arranged by Richard to sleep upstairs; the dining hall downstairs was not allowed to stay long for it was used for holding parties, so it was also a kind of public place. The only place which totally appertained to her was the inconspicuous attic room. Originally it was an abandoned and marginal place, yet was endowed with special glamour with Clarissa staying inside. It became a space for her to rejuvenate and regenerate. This is much similar with what Bell Hooks highlights and pursuits in Yearning: Race, Gender; and Cultural Politics, which is selected by Soja as the expansion of Thirdspace on feminist criticism. Bell Hooks in this book proposes her solution as a marginalized black women scholar-"choosing marginality as radical difference" (96). As an African American feminist scholar, Bell Hooks cannot infuse authentically into mainstream American intellectuals for her African and female identity. Meanwhile, she cannot return back to her original nation for she has been shaped by American social value. In consequence, she can only live in a marginal circumstance. But it is in this marginality Bell Hooks finds opportunity and activity, a powerful space embraces initiation and inclusiveness. Traditionally domestic space is overlooked and regarded as insignificant. Here Hooks insists that "homeplace has been a site of resistance" (47). It is in this so-called meaningless space she constructs her identity and sustains her subjectivity, thus transforming it into a new location to articulate her sense of the world. In her essay "An Aesthetic of Blackness: Strange and Oppositional", she has further stressed the importance and subversive value of domestic space-"in that space of shadows we long for an aesthetic of blackness" (72). Likewise, Clarissa chooses marginality, the attic room, as a place for unlimited possibility, breaking up oppressive congeniality.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="44" id="mark-c3cbe626-fc98-47b1-91b0-6e0b0015e0bd" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa retreated twice to the little room in the attic. The first time was when she was told Lady Bruton only invited Richard for lunch. Being conscious of her subordinate and isolated situation, Clarissa told herself to "fear no more" (26) and later she went to the attic room upstairs. "Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went, upstairs" (27). In this little room she could take off her womanly apparel; she could read Baron Marbot's memoirs freely; she allowed herself to be immersed in the past memory with Sally, forgetting the title of a perfect hostess. She reflected that back in Bourton, she had the pure and integrated feelings for Sally. "Had not that, after all, been love?" (29). However, towards men she had an inert coldness and detest. Outside this room, she had to do everything according to the social norm. She had never set her inner feelings free. Here in this attic room, Clarissa possessed no longer her socially accepted identity-Richard Dalloway's wife. She was able to face her true desire, and her true nature as a homosexual person. Together with Sally, she could talk freely about sex, the catastrophic nature of marriage, how to change the world,and read Plato,Shelly and William Morris <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="12" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c37"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>7</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> . The most exciting moment of life in Bourton was that Sally once kissed her when she went to see her with a white shirt. All these things became taboos after she got married with Richard Dalloway. Fortunately, in this secluded space Clarissa could return back to be herself.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="45" id="mark-c1af0ecb-d37b-4eb8-b115-14cae2d4d74a" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Here the mirror in the attic room is also a significant image. In Production, Lefebvre points out that the mirror discloses the relationship between him and himself; it reproduces and displays what he is into the sign of what he is. The whole process is what Lefebvre says "in order to know myself, 'I separate myself out from myself"" (185). In a word, in Lefebvre the mirror is a space which is both imaginary with respect to origin and separation, but also concrete and practical with respect to coexistence and differentiation (186). Via looking into the mirror, Clarissa saw her face, recalled her personality, and confronted directly her innermost desire and undisguised ego. In this real and imagined space, Clarissa unfolded her true self, which she noticed immediately. "That was her self when some effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together, she alone knew how different, how incompatible" (33).</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The second time was when Clarissa heard of Septimus' death at her party. While other guests were criticizing this event, Clarissa quietly went on into the attic room. She conceived of the scene of Septimus' death. And she imagined so vividly that it seemed she also experienced death herself. We know that Woolf in the original plan of Mrs. Dalloway does not create the character Septimus Smith; it is Clarissa who is going to kill herself at the end. Later Septimus, as Clarissa's substitute, is produced and it is he instead of Clarissa chooses to commit suicide. So here it is no wonder to find that</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="46" id="mark-e4d96d03-e840-41aa-9ef7-56524b72ff5c" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Clarissa totally understood Septimus' action. She knew that the young man killed himself in order to preserve something. She asked herself: "Had he plunged with his treasure?" (173). And Clarissa was "glad that he had done it; thrown it away while they went on living" (174). What does Septimus preserve? What does this "treasure" refer to? Why does Clarissa feel glad? I argue that it is his true self that Septimus preserves through suicide, something that Clarissa herself has lost. However, Septimus' death brought it back to her. His death helped her to separate herself from the harsh reality and remind of the past light-hearted life. Once again she recalled the countryside life at Bourton with her used partner Sally. Back in Bourton she would look at the sky at dinner time; now in London, when she could not sleep she would walk to window and do the same thing. For in the sky there was "something of her own in it" (174). So it is again in this attic room that Clarissa manages to get rid of the external voice and emancipates herself in her inner world. By identifying with Septimus, she also preserves her true self.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>An attic room is originally a marginalized place, however, Clarissa does not passively let herself located in marginality. She actively chooses marginality as a site of resistance, gets rid of oppressive hierarchical power, and achieves self-emancipation and self-revival. For one thing, Clarissa remains her identity of being the other; for another, as Soja say, she seeks to find "more flexible ways of becoming open to coalitions and coalescences of radical subjectivities" (117). Whether getting immersed in the childhood memory, meditating upon Septimus' death, or feeling glad for Septimus' suicide, Clarissa can be her true self here, with no need to bend to anyone else's will. Though the two persons do not use the same means, they arrive at the same destination. As for how Septimus' choice of suicide attains resistance and emancipation, it will be elaborated in the next part.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>B. Septimus' Room for Resistance</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>From Woolf's rough description of Septimus' background information we learn that Septimus is a low-middle class man in this city. He once wanted to be a poet in his young age. But there was no future for a poet in his little town, so he came to London. He moved from a relatively limited space to the center of England, this prosperous urban space. Living in a lodge in Euston road, he was urged to improve himself. During the day he worked in an office assiduously and read Keats, Shakespeare, and Bernard thirstily in the evening. He would also borrow books from the library and wrote to well-known authors for advice. Drinking, writing, pacing, and falling in love with Miss Pole, he lived an ordinary but hopeful life. Later when the war broke out, he was among the first to join the army. But things changed after he came back. We know his homosexual lover Evans died. Due to this harsh fact, Septimus developed shell-shocked disease. He had lost his feeling since then. As he himself claimed, "he could not feel" (80). With his social status and health condition declining, all his previous hope and ambition faded away. He had to marry a girl whom he did not love. In fact, his marriage resembled Clarissa's in some sense. Both of them used to live happily and freely. Later they both gave up their inner desire and surrendered to social morals and conventions. Similar to Clarissa's experience, Septimus often repelled at human nature and questions the world. They were the sober minds in this black-and-white reverse world. "For the truth is that human beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment" (83). Sitting on the chair in the park, he would think about love, crime, and the world. Yet his doubts only rendered his wife panic. Doctor Holmes scoffed at their shortage of money. And doctor Sir William Bradshaw simply asserted he was out of proportion, i.e. he was insane.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="47" id="mark-f481a668-2f11-4f4d-8f9d-dfbec7c0f0a9" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In a word, Septimus never entered into the pivotal position in social space. Before war he moved from a town space to the marginalized space in this city, but hopefully he was striving for a promising future; when the war was over, he and his wife were once again forced into a miserable situation. The hegemonic social power represented by doctor Bradshaw wanted to bend Septimus to its will. The only place where Septimus can feel absent from the outside dominance was his sitting-room. Ultimately, his resistance and refreshment was accomplished here by his embrace of death. Next I would like to analyze how in his sitting-room Septimus retains his true self.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When the doctors came to diagnose him, he was wise enough to see through their hypocrisy easily. He could clearly feel doctor Holmes' disdain when he came to his home. He knew it clear in that now he behaved abnormal, the doctors like Holmes and William Bradshaw would "scour the desert. They fly screaming into the wilderness. The rack and the thumbscrew are applied" (91). Ultimately doctor Bradshaw advised Septimus to go to the nursing home. Perceiving that Septimus was reluctant to obey his order, doctor Bradshaw went directly into his house, pushed his wife away and intended to take him. At that time Septimus was sitting in the sitting-room, serenely observing the shifting light and shadow that the sun casted over the wall. Though he thought he could not feel in the outside space, inside he could feel the affinity with nature again. He could hear the trees dragging leaves, river watering, and birds singing, and. It goes without saying that in this sitting-room, Septimus' ability of feeling gets refreshed. Those qualities he had once lost were recovered. He heard that his heart was telling him: "fear no more" (130). Actually he was rather relaxed in this internal space. Free from external oppression, it seemed that the romantic and poetic Septimus returned back and could breathe freely in this room. In a word, in this narrow and private space Septimus felt its beauty, its uniqueness, and its peacefulness.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="48" id="mark-fc7a493e-b9f0-47cc-8275-26dbee3839f3" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Until now, Septimus' sitting room functions for the most part as Clarissa's attic room. Like Bell Hooks' homeplace, these secret spaces function as sites of resistance, subversion, and also of refreshment. In the homeplace, women who grow up in it are certain that shaped by the space, but at the same time this is a place women learn about beauty, how to look at things, and recognize themselves. Ultimately they learn an aesthetic of blackness. Likewise, in these ignored spaces, Septimus and Clarissa turned their concentration from the outside world to the inside space, and actively learned to know themselves. During this process they constructed their subjectivity, maintained their complete and full personality, and obscured the original hierarchy and binary order. But then, doctor Bradshaw came to his room regardless of the objection of his wife, and intended to grasp him. With his last personal space being invaded, Septimus did not bow his head. He chose death as a way of rebelling against authority and holding his subjectivity. I would argue that though death seems a desperate choice for normal people, it has the special symbolization for Septimus and his double Clarissa. As was above-mentioned, Clarissa was glad that he did so. "People feeling the impossibility of reaching the center which, mystically, evaded the. . . . There was an embrace in death" (172-73). For Clarissa and Septimus, it was death that stood at the center of the world.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>By choosing a way of radical resistance, Septimus broke up the binary division of orthodox marginality and centrality, and found a new solution for his subordinated position.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="49" id="mark-81ffd32e-e6fd-4a8f-a6a0-d952eb866baa" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Therefore, Septimus' sitting room, this domestic place is a countering space where Septimus manages to transcend marginality and seeks for new possibility. It is a homeplace of Bell Hooks, and further a Thirdspace of Soja where he is able to dissolve the orthodox center, challenge the binary power relations, and eventually preserve his subjectivity, his completeness and his true self.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>C. Elizabeth's Remapping of the City</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Traditional spatial critique unusually connects space research with class, race, and culture, with the impact of gender always being forgotten or neglected. However, women are confined strictly in domestic place, living in the peripheral space with their voices and experience being submerged in human history. Even if a woman ventures into the public space in urban city, she would be criticized to have trespassed on male space. Seemingly urban space is not gendered, while in fact gender inequality is fused seamlessly into the construction of urban space manipulated by patriarchal power.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>As Soja says, though there is a long heritage of the analysis of the production of space in feminist critique, it has been only recently treated seriously in western culture and philosophy. In spatial feminist critique, "urban spatiality was seen as oppressively gendered in much the same way that the cityscape was shown to be structured by the exploitative class relations of capitalism and the discriminatory geographical effects of racism, the two other major channels developing over the same period in the spatial disciplines" (109). In other words, spatial feminist critique adds gender elements to spatial studies, after which gendered space studies along with those of class and race, further facilitates a more comprehensive and profound interpretation of spatial issues, especially of urban spatial criticism. Postmodern spatial feminism focuses on the spatialization of patriarchal power not only in the design of buildings, but in the very fabric of everyday city life.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Apart from Bell Hooks, Soja also lists other examples of postmodern feminist critique to amplify the dimension of Thirdspace. An appropriate example would be the works of Dolores Hayden. Hayden raises such a thought-provoking question: "What would a non-sexist city look like?" (109). She commits to unravel the oppression on women arising from masculinist and phallocentric urban spatiality, and aims at an active remapping of the city as a space of radical openness. Similar to Hooks' choice of marginality, it is a space of oppression and exploitation, but also a space potential for producing resistance and recovery. Here Dolores Hayden emphasizes the radical and active deconstruction of patriarchal spatial order, of the Man/Woman binary and a redesign of city space with an abundance of sexual possibilities, uncertainties, and opportunities.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="50" id="mark-49550315-4537-485a-98fa-93a9da8bf735" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Another postmodern feminist Trinh T. Minh-ha presents the strategy of displacement, which is opposite for the strategy of reversal. In When the Moon Waxes Red: Representation, Gender, and Cultural Politics she writes, "without a certain work of displacement, the margins can easily recomfort the center in goodwill and liberalism" (120). In her view, the emphasis of margin and center preserves the binary power relations. Only by displacing and disordering difference, can the rigid and ordered power relations be eliminated. This is in some sense identified with Spivak's idea, which is also quoted in Soja's analysis. "In a certain sense, I think there is nothing that is central. The center is always constituted in its own marginality" (40). In Spivak, choosing marginality becomes an invitingly anarchic, centerless act of inclusion.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In a word, spatial feminist critique acknowledges women's marginalized position, but they insist on the importance and openness of marginality, with traditional female space reinterpreted and relocated. They try to break up and transcend the categorical classification of space, find a third-of-other space, thereby canceling patriarchal hegemony.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In Mrs. Dalloway, Elizabeth Dalloway, Clarissa's daughter, was not supposed to wander freely in the street. Unlike her mother to whom the titles of perfect hostess, and good wife are attributed to, Elizabeth was lacking in feminine qualities from the outset in many people's eyes. Peter Walsh compared her as a horse. Even her mother Clarissa did not think that she resembled a Dalloway. When Miss Kilman, the embodiment of the suffocating religion, attempted to take command of her as she used to do with Clarissa, she did not succumb to Miss Kilman's will. Instead, she dumped her, and went out from the inside store to the outside Victorian street. Next she took an omnibus ride and risked as a solitary flaneur in the city. Contrary to Peter Walsh's casual flaneur in the street, Elizabeth's roaming is not an easy chance and it has particular significance for her. Next I would like to apply postmodern feminist spatial thinking, which echoes Soja's Thirdspace, to probe into how Elizabeth's wandering in the series of public spaces, her exploration and experience in these spaces help her to recover herself and maintain her completeness.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="51" id="mark-77f6c057-f8cc-434b-95a4-6dabbbee9c35" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>When Elizabeth came out from the store, she stepped into the broad traditionally-masculine spaces. She was glad to have an opportunity roaming around outside. "It was so nice to be out of doors. She thought perhaps she did not need to not go home just yet. It was so nice to be out in the airs" (125-26). Yet as a girl with well cut clothes, while she was waiting there, people began their criticism on her. They compared her to poplar trees, lilies, running water, etc. All these feminized metaphors made her feel uncomfortable, reminding her of the pleasant life in the country. This scene proves itself obviously the power of patriarchal hegemony in public space. Elizabeth would not let herself exposed under such criticism so she got on a bus. When the bus began rushing up Whitehall, she felt it was like riding, and herself, was like the rider. Free of patriarchal suppression, though transiently, Elizabeth regained her subjectivity. Then she rode further to the Strand and got off. Though she was evaluated by the mainstream force in the city on the one hand, she was also observing and experiencing it through her own female sight on the other hand. She compared the bus to an eel; she saw Somerset House as a splendid great building; she was also intrigued by the churches, like shapes of grey paper, breasting the stream of the Strand. She saw people busying with their various activities: ships, business, law, and administration. Her personal and fleshly bodily experience in the city is exactly a kind of revolting in Lefebvre. All the cityscape was so stately, gay, and pious that Elizabeth spontaneously had a yearning for a profession in the future. She determined to be a doctor, a farmer, or go into Parliament, and all these because of she was standing in the Strand. So in this short while, a temporal displacement as Trinh T. Minh-ha states is achieved. Elizabeth is no longer in an oppressed position. She becomes capable of striding on this street like its owner rather than a subordinate. The fixed division between center and margin, and men and women, is dispelled under her striding in the street.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="52" id="mark-a628300d-b035-4ea1-b17c-436c3924c4b7" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>At the same time, Elizabeth's experience of this public space is not a masculine one. Her impression of the scene in the street is warm, peaceful, and not in the least aggressive. By doing so, a sort of aesthetic between feminine and masculine is constructed. This reminds us of what Hooks' grandmother Baba does in describing her little house. Though it is dark and rife with shadows, Baba can always find beauty and light in it. Hooks thinks of it as an aesthetic of blackness. This is exactly what Soja says "to give voice and to assert radical subjectivity" (14). In Elizabeth's initial experience of these traditionally masculine spaces, the boundaries between man and woman turn vague and vanishing. The dichotomous power relations seem not to be that firm any more.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Even so, Elizabeth could not forget her female identity. She could still perceive the hidden masculine intimidation so that she proceeded carefully-"shyly, like someone penetrating on tiptoe, exploring a strange house by night with a candle" (128). In comparison, Peter Walsh had totally different feeling from her. "His light overcoat blew open, he stepped with indescribable idiosyncrasy, learnt a little forward, tripped, with his hands behind his back and his eyes still a hawk-like" (153). Peter could observe and this city with his master-like manner. However, Elizabeth seemed more like an outsider. Despite this, Elizabeth did not flinch. She described herself as "a pioneer, a stray, venturing, trusting" (128). Indeed, Elizabeth is a pioneer. She bravely steps onto the intimidating masculine space, and transforms it into a city of what Dolores Hayden calls as a non-sexist space.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In conclusion, in her aimless roaming around the street, the urban city is "remapped" by Elizabeth to be a space of radical openness and possibilities. Through this trivial everyday activity, Elizabeth manages to accomplish resistance against patriarchal hegemony. What used to be ascribed to men is tinged with female color in Elizabeth's eyes. Consequently, the city is turned into a Thirdspace of not only subjection and oppression but also of recovery and revival. Along with Clarissa, Elizabeth challenges the stiff hierarchical and patriarchal power, gets rid of the conventional female images, and builds up her individual identity in this process.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="53" id="mark-ab44b0ea-a358-4f5c-92e8-55de47619850" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>Conclusion</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Since from Lefebvre's declaration, space has ceased to be a void container or setting. It has been increasingly interpreted with latent layers of connotations. In recent years, space has further been intensively discussed in the realm of literature research. Lefebvre highlights that space works as a tool to analyze the society. Any kind of space is tainted with social implications. Thus, when connected with literature, his spatial theories are utilized for the most part to analyze its social and political dimension. This study,also,is developed around the political and social concern of space in <mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="13" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D440 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D45F TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D460 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi></mjx-texatom></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi>M</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> Dalloway.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>Space has never been a secondary constituent in Woolf's works. As a modernist forerunner discontent with traditional literary forms, she elevates space to the overt position, endowing it with complicated significance. As is acknowledged by many scholars, space is an integral part of Woolf's writing. "The psychology of space", say Anna Snaith and Michael H. Whitworth, "resonates through her autobiographical writing, from the claustrophobic, Victorian rooms of Hyde Park Gates, heavy with tangled emotions, to the airy, liberating rooms of 46 Gordon Square, Bloomsbury" (1). Mrs. Dalloway, with its setting in urban London, is also excavated in terms of space. Research has been done on diverse spaces and spatial narrative in this novel. What is insufficient is that Woolf's space scholarship inclines to fall into a dichotomous opposition. This study is focalized around characters' body space, the urban space, and the promising Thirdspace, aiming to unravel the spatiality of Mrs. Dalloway from a different perspective.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The argument of this thesis is that in Mrs. Dalloway space is not categorized into a dichotomous system, such as the opposition of male and female space, city and country space, or urban and country space. To think it this way would miss Woolf's efforts of breaking up dichotomy and searching for subversion and resistance in her writing. My point is that on one hand individuals are repressed both in their body space and in the exterior urban space; on the other hand, there exists the possibility of Thirdspace where people can try to revolt against repression and retain their subjectivity.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="54" id="mark-93800af1-ca1e-4b72-8276-658553997b1e" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>This thesis commences from the level of body space, exploring the disciplined bodies and their alienation in everyday life. Then it examines the repressive force of space from a broader level-urban space, revealing the invisible hierarchy, hegemony and patriarchy incarnated in space. Finally, it scrutinizes the existence of Thirdspace as a space of openness and difference in Mrs. Dalloway. All of Clarissa, Septimus and Elizabeth manage to resistance against hegemonic power and get access to be their true selves.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>For Lefebvre the body is itself a space and it produces its own space. The starting point of the production of space is the production of the body. Body and space, the two elements are interdependent. For one thing, the body actively participates in the production of space; for another, it is unavoidably restricted by the rules of the production of space. In modern capitalist society, in order to make the maximum benefit in the production of space, space is calculated precisely; accordingly, the body is restricted to the utmost, which is achieved through discipline towards individual bodies. This gives rise to omnipresent alienation in everyday life. Besides, alienation for Lefebvre is not limited in its political and economic dimension; actually it is the everyday phenomenon of everyone's life. On this basis, chapter one firstly analyzes the disciplining process on individual bodies from several aspects: the royalty, religion, medical system, and the restriction of body energy. Then it tackles on the pervasive alienation of individuals in everyday life, including a sense of self-fragmentation, estrangement, displacement and distance. In the end, the crossing of cyclical and lineal time also hints at people's seriously alienated life.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>After the repressed condition of individual bodies is revealed, the external urban space is discussed. Capitalism attempts to hide heterogeneity and difference and casts its intention into the production of space. As a whole, urban space is the embodiment of ideologies, knowledge and discourse of the dominant class. So hierarchy, hegemony, and patriarchy are embedded in the disposition of space and spatial metaphor. The upper class lives in the upscale communities while the poor are driven into the periphery of the city. For example, Lady Bruton lived in Mayfair. She could participate in various parties and activities, whereas the poor families in Westminster could only rest at the square or the park. At her party Lady Bruton sit in the central position, with the painting of the General behind her hanging back on the wall. The painting hints at Lady Bruton's high social rank among her guests. Likewise, at Clarissa's party, when the Prime Minister came, people unconsciously gave way to him. Instantly the Prime Minister became the focus of the party. All these spatial activities imply the hidden class hierarchy and hegemony in the capitalist society. Apropos as patriarchy, it is also not rarely seen in this novel. Peter Walsh's complacency after following a woman in the street, Hugh's pompous manner when meeting Clarissa, and Clarissa's limited activity space compared with her husband all illustrate its incarnation in lived space.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="55" id="mark-d2aef877-a448-4d41-9723-1ab8487da981" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>The last chapter aims to seek the possibility of Thirdspace in this novel. First of all, what is noteworthy is the similarity between Woolf's thoughts and Soja's Thirdspace. Woolf's insist on women's own room and her innovation in androgyny instead of accepting single gender identity echo with Soja's searching for Thirdspace as a space of radical openness and difference. Then I take Clarissa's attic room and Septimus's sitting-room as examples to manifest the existence of Thirdspace in Mrs. Dalloway. Both of the two persons' active choice in their own room finds response in Bell Hooks' choosing marginality. Differing from Clarissa and Septimus, Elizabeth achieves her resistance and self-revival by boldly wandering in the street. The street is usually regarded as a male place, so Elizabeth feels threatened when she firstly touches the field. However, her female experience challenges the center-peripheral position and blurs the boundary, which is what Trinh calls displacement. Through remapping the city, Elizabeth rediscovers the radical possibility and inclusiveness of it, altering the city into a space of refreshment and emancipation.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>In summary, this thesis disagrees with the dichotomous logic of present space studies in Mrs Dalloway. in the first two chapters it exposes the repressive nature of society both from the perspective of individual body space and external urban space in Mrs. Dalloway, and in the last chapter, which is also the most essential chapter, it manages to unveil the space of resistance and emancipation-Thirdspace. Ultimately, it is evidenced that as a modernist, Woolf not only seeks revolution in literary forms, but also tries to seek solutions to social ills by virtue of writing. Due to the author's limitation of knowledge and inadequate experience in academic research, there is still insufficiency in this study. Hopefully this thesis would shed new light on future space</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="56" id="mark-e2985e06-858d-4b4b-b3aa-15da87e7cefa" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div>researches of Mrs. Dalloway.</div></div></div></span></div></div></div></div><div><div class="relative cursor-pointer md-tranlate-menu-layout"><div data-page="57" id="mark-b367716e-c943-4da7-bebb-a0b85e85d55f" class="markdown-parser-view mb-5 relative cursor-pointer"><div><span style="display: block;"><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><h2><div><div>Notes</div></div></h2><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="14" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> The two words "is" and "its" are used in italics originally in The Production of Space, so here they are also quoted in italics.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="15" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c32"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> In The Production of Space,Lefebvre states that the organs of massive-energy use are the muscles, and most importantly, the sex organs, which are the pole where such energy accumulates explosively. The organs of small-scale use energy lie in the sensory organs, the afferent and efferent nerve pathways, and the brain (195-96). In particular, the visual sensation is becoming exceeding emphasized compared with other sensory organs in the capitalist society. Thus Lefebvre calls for a restoration of the body, i.e. the restoration of non-visual sensation, of speech, of the voice, of smell, and of hearing, and of the sexual.</div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="16" style="font-size: 116.9%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-msup><mjx-texatom texclass="ORD"></mjx-texatom><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.363em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c33"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msup><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> Undoubtedly Clarissa is a middle class hostess,but before that she lives in the village Bourton.
